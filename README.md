# Ruby on Rails tutorial sample application 

This is the sample application for 
['Ruby on Rails Tutorial by Michael Hartl']

# This implementation is mantained by Bruno de Campos

## Getting started

To get started with the app, clone the repo and then install the needed gems:

```
$ bundle install --without production
```

Next, migrate the database:

```
$ rails db:migrate
```

Finally, run the test suite to verify that everything is working correctly:

```
$ rails test
```

If the test suite passes, you'll be ready to run the app in a local server:

```
$ rails server
```

And that's it!



This is the first application for the Ruby on Rails tutorial (book) by Michael Hartl
